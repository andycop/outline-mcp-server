## Commit Message Guidelines

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification for our commit messages. This leads to more readable messages that are easy to follow when looking through the project history and enables automatic versioning and changelog generation.

### Commit Message Format

Each commit message consists of a **header**, a **body**, and a **footer**. The header has a special format that includes a **type**, a **scope**, and a **subject**:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

The **header** is mandatory and the **scope** of the header is optional.

### Type

Must be one of the following:

- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, etc)
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance
- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
- **ci**: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts
- **chore**: Other changes that don't modify src or test files
- **revert**: Reverts a previous commit

### Scope

The scope should be the name of the npm package affected (as perceived by the person reading the changelog generated from commit messages).

### Subject

The subject contains a succinct description of the change:

- use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
- don't capitalize the first letter
- no dot (.) at the end

### Body

The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.

### Footer

The footer should contain any information about **Breaking Changes** and is also the place to reference GitHub issues that this commit **Closes**.

**Breaking Changes** should start with the word `BREAKING CHANGE:` with a space or two newlines. The rest of the commit message is then used for this.

### Examples

```
feat(api): add ability to specify document templates

Adds a new parameter to document creation to specify if it's a template.

Closes #123
```

```
fix(auth): handle expired tokens properly

BREAKING CHANGE: The auth token format has changed and requires re-authentication.
```

```
docs(readme): update installation instructions
```

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations, and container parameters.
3. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/). The version will be automatically bumped based on your commit messages.
4. You may merge the Pull Request once you have the sign-off of at least one other developer, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the reviewer to merge it for you.
