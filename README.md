# Outline MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides tools for interacting with [Outline](https://www.getoutline.com/)'s API, enabling AI agents to manage documents, collections, and other entities programmatically through the Outline knowledge base platform.

> **Upgrade Notice:**

- v5 has introduced several breaking changes:
  - this server support for both `stdio` and `sse` transport interfaces. It now solely exposes a [Streamable HTTP endpoint](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/draft/basic/transports#streamable-http) at the `/mcp` route. If you require sse/stdio, downgrade to v4
  - the `--port` CLI flag has been migrated to an environment variable, `OUTLINE_MCP_PORT`

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v20 or higher)
- Outline account with API access
- Outline API key with appropriate permissions
- Note: if you need to use the AI-powered ask feature, you must enable the "AI Answers" feature in your Outline Workspace settings

### Installation

```bash
# (preferred) Run directly with npx
OUTLINE_API_KEY=... npx outline-mcp-server

# or install from npm
npm install -g outline-mcp-server
OUTLINE_API_KEY=... outline-mcp-server
```

### Env

- `OUTLINE_API_KEY` (_required_): your API key for outline, duh
- `OUTLINE_API_URL` (_optional_): Alternative URL for your outline API (if using an alt domain/self-hosting)
- `OUTLINE_MCP_PORT` (_optional_): Specify the port on which the server will run (default: 6060)

### Usage

Once installed, you can use the MCP server with AI assistants that support the Model Context Protocol, such as Claude via Cursor.

Example queries your AI assistant can now handle:

- "List all the documents in my Outline workspace"
- "Create a new document in the 'Product' collection"
- "Find all documents related to a specific topic"
- "Ask a natural language question about your documents"
- "Create a template from an existing document"
- "Update the content of a document"
- "Add a comment to a document"

### Run the MCP server

```bash
# Default port 6060
OUTLINE_API_KEY=... npm run start:http

# Or specify a custom port
OUTLINE_API_KEY=... OUTLINE_MCP_PORT=9001 npm run start:http
```

## Development

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/mmmeff/outline-mcp.git
cd outline-mcp

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### Create a `.env` file with your Outline API key:

```
OUTLINE_API_KEY=your_outline_api_key_here

# Optional -------
# OUTLINE_API_URL=https://your-outline-instance.com/api # defaults to https://app.getoutline.com/api
# OUTLINE_MCP_PORT=9001
```

```bash
# Builds/watches the project alongside running @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
npm run dev
```
